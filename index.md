# Welcome to the LTG Documentation pages!

The purpose of this website is to collect the documentation of all the software porduced by the Learning Technologies Group at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Documentations are divided by projects. If a project is not listed here, likely there is no documentation for it yet. Sorry... 

## Projects

* [The Hunger Games](https://github.com/ltg-uic/hunger-games/wiki)
* [Phenomena Server](https://github.com/ltg-uic/phenomena-server/wiki)

## Other stuff
In this section you can find the documentation for all the cross-project libraries and tools that we are developing/developed

* A [simple XMPP client](https://github.com/ltg-uic/simple-java-xmpp-client) written in Java and based on [Smack](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/)
* An [event handlig library](https://github.com/ltg-uic/ltg-java-event-handler) written in Java to handle the events generated by our applications. Before diving into this, make sure you take a peet at the structure of [LTG events](https://github.com/ltg-uic/ltg-java-event-handler/wiki).
* A tool to handle [student rosters](https://github.com/ltg-uic/ltg-student-roster-tool) whenever we go in classrooms and run our applications.
